/**
* @short Interface for a manager of a version control system (VCS).
*
* This interface defines the common methods a manager for a concrete VCS has to provide.
* A VcsManager operates a local working copy of the remote (either truly remote or local) VCS.
* The VcsManager provides methods to import, update and retrieve files to and from the VCS.
* Due to the nature of a working copy of a VCS the manager does not provide direct access to
* the files in the working copy. All files are copied into the working copy for import/update
* operations and copied to an exchange location for retrieval operations. This is required due to
* the fact that another update operation might overwrite a retrieved file and the File handle
* returned previously would not point to the retrieved revision anymore.
*
* To use a VcsManager the init method has to be invoked.
*
* Due to the nature of a working copy all methods can alter the state of the working copy. This
* implies that all methods are neither reentrant nor thread-safe. It is recommended to the
* implementation of this interface to use pessimistic locking. If a concrete implementation is
* thread safe it should state this in it's documentation. For users of the VcsManager it is
* recommended to expect the worst and ensure locking itself, if possible. As a matter of fact
* it is also recommended to not modify the working copy from outside the application.

*
*
*
* This interface has been modified from a 'file oriented' view to 'model oriented'. Here a folder 
* is associated with a model, with files added and retrieved through specified
* revisions of the model folder. The interface has been considerably modified including
* the following behaviours: the initRepository no longer throws an exception if a
* repository is already inited. Conversely, the functions that previously used to
* throw an exception when the repository was not inited no longer do so, instead 
* the repository should be inited. This is because repository folders are now to be
* generated dynamically, which will make initing manually as part of the system 
* setup infeasible.
