 * @short Listener for new revisions and models for indexing.

 * This class is meant to be executed as a (singleton) spring bean
 * which listens for events generated by the model service (new models/new revisions).
 * An indexwriter is kept open (maintaining an exclusive lock on the search index)
 * and new models/revisions are indexed as they arrive. The class is also used to
 * get a searchermanager, utilising the Lucene Near Realtime Search mechanism.
