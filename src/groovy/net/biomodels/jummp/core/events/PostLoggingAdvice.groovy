/**
 * @short Advice for logging events post method execution.
 *
 * The advice is used as an advisor for methods annotated by the
 * PostLogging Annotation. It's main purpose is to create a LoggingEvent
 * broadcasted to all interested parties. The LoggingEvent informs about
 * which method was executed with which arguments and the return value.
 * Additionally from the Annotation the LoggingEventType is retrieved and
 * from the SpringSecurityContext the user who accessed the method.
